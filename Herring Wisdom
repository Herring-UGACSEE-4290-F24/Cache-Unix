Parts of the trace:
    OFFSET: Practically means nothing, this would be for selecting a 
            byte of data in a block BUT we  don't  care  about data.

    INDEX : Indicates which ROW you are checking values in! With  an 
            associativity > 1, you WILL be checking multiple  values 
            all in the SAME row!

    TAG   : VERY IMPORTANT -> this is the value that  is  stored  at 
            the index. When the value is not there, it  is  a  MISS, 
            when it is there, it is a HIT. (make sure to also  check 
            the dirty bit). Note: you also have to check multiple of
            the same row when there is associativity, and that means
            that a miss will change one of the values, and the  LRU,
            decides which.

    LRU   : Number of bits will be log2(Associativity).
